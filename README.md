# RF-Finney-County
This repository includes all the Python programming language scripts developed for long-term groundwater level (GWL) projections in Finney County in southwest Kansas, using the combination of the random forests (RF) and ordinary kriging techniques. The repository also includes all required data for running the scripts. GWL projections are done for various climate and managament scenarios. The Scikit-learn library is used to construct the RF model and the ArcPy package is utilized for all geospatial and geostatistical analysis.
